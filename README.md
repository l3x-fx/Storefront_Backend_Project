- `Postgres`: Database management to store and organize product and user-related data.
- `Node/Express`: Application logic implementation to handle server-side operations and requests.
- `dotenv`: Efficient management of environment variables for enhanced security and configuration.
- `jsonwebtoken`: Facilitating the use of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and authenticated communication.
- `bycropt`: Hashing algorithm for securing sensitive information, such as user passwords.
- `Coffee and Cats`: Fueling productivity and adding a touch of fun to the development process. Because every great tech stack deserves a little inspiration and companionship! ☕🐱

This tech stack ensures a robust and secure foundation for the development of the online storefront API.
